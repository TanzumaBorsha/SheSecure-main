          <p className="text-gray-500 font-medium">Web design involves creating the visual layout and aesthetics of a website, focusing on user experience, graphics, and overall look. Front-end development, on the other hand, involves implementing the design into a functional website using coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

          Web design has come a long way since the first site was published in 1991. With over one billion live websites on the internet today, it's no surprise that this industry is here to stay. Wix is home to thousands of website design professionals, enthusiasts, and designers who are empowering the industry to reach new heights. So, if you're here to learn more about the world of web design, you've come to the right place.

          Web design is the art of planning and arranging content on a website so that it can be shared and accessed online with the world. A combination of aesthetic and functional elements, web design is a type of digital design that determines the look of a websiteâ€”such as its colors, fonts, graphics and user interface (see our guide on website design best practices).

          Today, creating a website is one of the pillars of having an online presence. Because of this, the world of web design is as dynamic as ever. It is constantly evolving, including mobile apps and user interface design, to meet the growing needs of website owners and visitors alike.
          Web design is often a collaborative process that combines knowledge and tools from related industries, ranging from web design statistics to SEO optimization and UX. Web designers will often bring together professionals from these areas who can optimize performance and focus on the larger process and outcome.

          The first step in our web design journey is to clarify the difference between web design and website development, since the two are closely related and often (mistakenly) used interchangeably: Web design refers to the visual design and experiential aspects of a particular website. We're going to dive into more detail about web design throughout the rest of this article. Website development refers to the building and maintenance of a website's structure, and involves intricate coding systems that ensure the website functions properly.

          However, if you use a CMS (a computer software application that manages the digital content of a website) you can learn how to make a website and make updates without the knowledge of using code. Wix is an example of a CMS, which functions as a user-friendly system for website content development. Wix even offers you a way to design a website with AI .
